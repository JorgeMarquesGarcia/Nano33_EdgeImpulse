# Nano33_EdgeImpulse


Practice 2 of the subject sensor networks. 

Note that the firts two points of the practice are not done because my module Arduino Nano 33 BLE has the microphone broken. To prove that, see in dataset/trainning/Prueba_microphone.wav. 
I have also tested the microphone with the documentation https://github.com/DaleGia/Nano33BLESensor and there is no data printed in the serial monitor so, I assume the microphone is broken or its connections.
